🛒 E-Grocery Super Market Website

A Static, Desktop-View Product Listing Page

This project is a static E-Grocery Super Market webpage built using HTML5 and CSS3. It displays a clean product listing layout designed only for desktop screens. The purpose of this project was to practice designing a structured product grid, creating discount badges, styling buttons, and building a simple e-commerce-style UI using pure HTML and CSS .

📌 Features (Static )
✔️ Fixed-layout grocery homepage (desktop only)
✔️ Search bar and product sorting UI
✔️ Grid-based product display using static widths
✔️ Discount labels (Sale, Hot, 10% Off, Buy 1 Get 1, etc.)
✔️ Price & rating section on each product card
✔️ Clean spacing and image placement.

🧱 Tech Stack Used

HTML5 – Page structure
CSS3 – Styling only (no media queries, no responsiveness)
Font Awesome – Icons for UI details.
